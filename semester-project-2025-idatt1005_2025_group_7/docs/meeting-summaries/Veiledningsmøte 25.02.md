# Weekly meeting with Scott (25.02.2025) (Online Teams meeting)

Attendants: 
- Scott 
- Tord
- William

# Status

### Development
- Working with JavaFX is going well.
    - Tord is working on adding more views

- Hector has been working on the 'functionality' (basic entity classes etc.)

Scott advised us to continually make unit tests **during** the development, and not after.

### Diagrams
- Completed first draft of domain model (needs more work though)
- Working on a sequence diagram for the whole system
- Have started working on class diagram (will be updated in conjunction with models- and entity-classes)

# Other
Use GitHub pipelines (actions / workflows) for building the maven project (CD), as well as runing all tests (CI). Setup this (if not already done).

Scott is away next week as well, so the meeting will once again be held online on Teams. He expects it to be around 11:00, but will keep us updated by email.
